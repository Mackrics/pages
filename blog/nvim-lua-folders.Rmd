This is a blog post in my series about what I wish I knew before I wrote my
first Neovim plugin. If you have not already read part 1, check it out
[here](./nvim-lua.qmd).
:::

One of the most difficult things for me to find information about for my first
Neovim plugin, was how I would go from a function in `init.lua`, to a full-blown
package which I could install from my plugin manager. In particular, it was
difficult to understand the folder structure of the different packages I
studied.

It turns out that the process is very similar to how you would do it for other
programming languages when writing a package. There are only two
directories required: `./lua/` and `./plugin/`.

```sh
.
├── lua
│   ├── first-function.lua
│   ├── second-function.lua
│   ├── third-function.lua
│   └── fourth-function.lua
└── plugin
   └── package-name.lua
```

## `./lua/`

The lua directory contains the lua functions of your package. You could put all
the functions in a single file, but it is good practice to factor out functions
into separate files, or at least group similar functions into a single file.

As an example, let's say that the content of `./lua/hello.lua` is:

```lua
function hello()
  local message = 'hello, world!'
  print(message)
end
```

I.e, it defines the lua function `hello()`

## `./plugin/`

The plugin directory is what is loaded by the package manager. The main purpose
of the files here is to source the required lua functions and define the
user-facing functions. You can think of this as the "`init.lua`" of your package.

As an example, if we want to export the hello world function we defined in 
`./lua/hello.lua`.

```lua
require('hello')

vim.api.nvim_create_user_command(
  'Hello',
  'lua hello()',
  {}
)
```

This will then export the lua function so that it can be called from the Neovim 
command mode as `Hello`.

Congratulations, you now have a minimal viable package which can be installed
from your favorite Neovim package manager.
