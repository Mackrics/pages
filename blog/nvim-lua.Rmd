I recently wrote my first Neovim plugin[^1] to learn more about how Neovim plugins
work and to try to customize my development environment further. It was a bit
difficult to get started with developing Neovim plugins and finding good resources,
so I will try to summarize what I wish I knew before I got started.

## It is relatively simple to call Lua from Neovim

I wanted to write a Neovim plugin for a long while, but postponed it since I
thought it would be very difficult. However, Lua is relatively easy to learn
and is quite similar to R/Python/Julia making it easy to learn if you come from
a data science background. Furthermore, there a lot of Neovim apis which you
can take advantage of when writing your plugin, most of which are well
documented.

Lua is well integrated into Neovim and is pretty straightforward to call. In
fact, you can call Lua directly from the Neovim command mode. The hello world
example of this would be:

```lua 
:lua print('hello world')
```

Which is very similar to how you would do it in R/Python/Julia. 

If you have already setup your `init.lua` file to configure Neovim, you can
define Lua functions directly in your `init.lua` file. If you for example want
to define a hello world function you can copy and paste the following in your
`init.lua`:

```lua
function hello(name)
  local message = 'hello ' .. name .. '!' -- Two dots are used to glue strings
  print(message)
end
```

Which will then enable you to call the following from the Neovim command mode
to print 'hello world!':

```lua
:lua hello('world')
```
Defining Lua functions and calling them directly from Neovim command mode
is pretty straightforward and will hopefully empower you to start defining some
functions yourself and dare to think about what types of functions you want
to configure.
