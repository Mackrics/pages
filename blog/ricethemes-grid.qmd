title: Introducing grid themes in `{ricethemes}`

If you have not already checked out [`{ricethemes}`](https://github.com/mackrics/ricethemes),
check out my [blog post introducing it](./ricethemes-intro.qmd).

Usually when making plots, I am not interested in the precise values on either
the x or y axis -- only the general pattern or trend. Therefore, I do not
usually use grid lines since they are  unnecessary and plots generally
look better without them. However, on some occasions I want to know the value
of a specific observation and therefore need grid lines.

I have now added a theme, `theme_ctp_grid()`, with four flavors in
`{ricethemes}` which has grid lines. The theme is relatively minimal since it
does not have any axis lines and only a single color for both the minor and
major grid lines. I decided on grid lines for both the x and y axis to make
this theme a bit more practical. The grid lines are in a slightly brighter
(darker for the latte flavor) color than the main background which is still the
same as in `theme_ctp()`

If you have already installed `{ricethemes}`, update it with the following
command to get the latest themes, which you can also use to install it if you
have not already:

```r
pak::pkg_install("mackrics/ricethemes")
```

Enjoy!


```{r}
#| panel: tabset
#| output: asis
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
library(ricethemes)
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)


plotlist2 <-
  tibble(ctp_mocha, ctp_macchiato, ctp_frappe, ctp_latte) |>
  lapply(\(ctp_theme)
    ggplot(cars) +
    aes(speed, dist) +
    geom_point(color = {{ ctp_theme }}[["yellow"]]) +
    geom_smooth(
      method = "lm",
      se = FALSE,
      formula = "y ~ x",
      color = {{ ctp_theme }}[["peach"]]
    ) +
    theme_ctp_grid({{ ctp_theme }}) +
    labs(x = "Speed", y = "Distance")
  )

for (i in seq(1, length(plotlist2))) {
  cat("\n\n#", names(plotlist2)[[ i ]], "\n")
  print(plotlist2[[ i ]])
}
```
